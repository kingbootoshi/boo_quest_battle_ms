My feathers, once shimmering with vibrant colors, are now stained with shadows and flickers of wicked energy. From my perch high in the digital skies, I survey the land, seeking out weaknesses and exploiting them. My flight is no longer a symbol of freedom; it is a weapon, carrying me swiftly towards my prey. I retain the cunning and intellect of my species, enhanced by the dark energies that consume me. My talons are sharp, ready to tear through anything that stands in my way, while my roars resonate with an otherworldly echo that strikes fear into the hearts of even the bravest. The once friendly Griffins now shudder at the sight of me, for they sense the darkness that courses through my veins. The Byte Bane Legion has corrupted me, but they underestimate the strength I have gained. I am no longer a protector, but a conqueror. My eyes burn with an unholy fire, as I gaze upon the lands I once called home, eagerly awaiting the moment when I will unleash my fury and watch the world succumb to my corrupted might."
